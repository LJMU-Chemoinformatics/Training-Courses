# Training Courses

All Coursera courses can be enrolled and taken for free allowing you to see the lecture content and questions. However, you will not recieve a certificate after completion, or be able to get answers to the questions. Paying for a courses works in a monthly subscription manner, but you will need to subscribe to each course inidvidually. Subscribing does not allow you access to all courses, just the specialization you have selected!

Watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxlQ7hHTto) to learn how to access each course for free.
